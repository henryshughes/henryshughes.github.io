                I currently work as a Research Assistant with Professor John Quilty at the University of Waterloo.
                His research focuses on using modern computational techniques to learn more about the development of hydrological
                forecasting. The main computational techniques include the following:   </br> </br>

                1. AI, machine learning, and deep learning.   </br>
                2. Coupling physical and data driven models.   </br>
                3. Developing uncertainty estimation methods for existing data driven models.

                </br> </br>
                More information can be found  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/jquilty/">here</a> about the research that Professor Quilty does.    </br> </br>

                I have supported Professor Quilty's research team in a number of ways:
                </br> </br>

                1. Helped debug code and complete data analysis in MATLAB that was used in the development of a paper that is currently under reivew. The paper was
                focused on comparing ELM, BELM, and SBELMs. </br>
                2. Completed a literature review focused on applications of Bayesian Extreme Learning Machines.  </br>
                3. Am currently developing ways to select input variables for SBELM neural networks.

                I am currently working on the rehabilitation of the Ashbridges Bay Water Treatment Plant in Toronto. It is the largest plant of 
                its kind in Ontario, and the second largest in Canada. I love being able to work on a large project that has such
                a major impact on the City of Toronto.

                During my time at WSP, I was able to work on a wide range of projects. 
                I was in a client facing role, which allowed me to develop my communication skills as well 
                as learn how to interact with clients and deal with any issues that arose. </br></br>

                My range of projects included retail infrastructure, land development and stormwater management infrastructure. 
                I was assigned to help manage over 10 projects at a time with my team which improved my time management skills.
                </br></br>
                
                The most enjoyable part of this term is when I was given the 
                opportunity to advise clients on the financial side of projects. 
                I was able to advise clients on potential partnerships and do this by developing excel 
                spreadsheets with analysis I had done on project financing.

                I was a Finance and Risk Intern at the Ministry of Finance before going to the University of Waterloo.

                I had the ability to use software to increase the efficienty of analysts at the Ministry. I developed programs in Visual Basic 
                to automatically perform tasks that were previously done manually. I also built a number of financial templates in Microsoft Excel
                that would automatically perform tax evaluation tasks.</br></br>
                
                I was also able to help work on an specialized audit in the mining sector. I worked on this project with a team and 
                was able to help present findings to a Senior Manager. This allowed me to see what goes on in an audit which was a
                great experience for me.
